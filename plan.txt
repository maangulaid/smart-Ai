Phase 4: Frame Classification (Start Now)
We'll now:

Load the google/vit-base-patch16-224 model from Hugging Face.

Use it to classify each image in the /frames directory.

Store or return the predicted labels for each frame.

Set up a simple /classify backend route to run classification.

Optionally, display those labels on the frontend per frame.
